# Boston-House-Price
The Boston Housing Price dataset, also known as the Boston Housing Dataset or simply the Boston dataset, is a widely used dataset in machine learning and statistics. 
It is often used for regression analysis and predictive modelling. 
The dataset provides information about various factors that may influence the median value of owner-occupied homes in Boston.
## Problem Statement:
**The Boston Housing Price dataset aims to predict the median value of owner-occupied homes (in thousands of dollars) based on various features or 
attributes related to the neighbourhoods in the Boston area. 
It serves as a regression problem, where the goal is to build a predictive model that can estimate house prices based on the given input features.**

# Dataset Features:
The dataset contains 13 different input features (predictors) that can be used to make predictions. These features include:  
**1.	CRIM: Per capita crime rate by town.    
 2.	ZN: Proportion of residential land zoned for large lots.   
 3.	INDUS: Proportion of non-retail business acres per town.  
 4.	CHAS: Charles River dummy variable (1 if tract bounds river; 0 otherwise).  
 5.	NOX: Nitrogen oxide concentration (parts per 10 million).  
 6.	RM: Average number of rooms per dwelling.  
 7.	AGE: Proportion of owner-occupied units built before 1940.  
 8.	DIS: Weighted distance to employment centres.  
 9.	RAD: Index of accessibility to radial highways.  
 10.	TAX: Property tax rate (in $1,000s).  
 11.	PTRATIO: Pupil-teacher ratio by town.  
 12.	B: Proportion of residents of African American descent.  
 13.	LSTAT: Percentage of lower-status population.**  

## Target Variable:   
The target variable is:  
**14.	MEDV: Median value of owner-occupied homes in $1,000s.**   

 Machine learning models can be trained on this dataset to predict the MEDV value based on the other features. 
The dataset is commonly used for regression tasks to understand how various factors impact housing prices and to build models that can predict the prices of new properties based on these factors.
Researchers and data scientists often use this dataset to explore regression techniques, evaluate model performance, 
and study the relationships between the features and the target variable in the context of real estate and housing market analysis.
